Thanks for visiting this page. I am a quantitative social scientist and professional researcher. Please consult these links for further information about my background and research {[google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6KLv8dEAAAAJ&hl=en), [professional CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o7xilz8e9tom1mrjhm2eq/Gell-Redman_CV_QuantUXR.pdf?rlkey=4rshpayh370qke5cm07bpxszg&dl=0), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micah-gell-redman/)}.

Here is an example of a previous project.

# Project: 
Measure user value from business messages to ensure sustainable growth of a massive private messaging network

# Role: 
Staff Quantitative User Researcher

# Brief: 
Create a new source of information about users' experience of business messages. Ensure user experience remains positive as platform grows.

# Approach: 

 - Work with product and engineering to understand business needs and constraints

 - Identify the contribution of research to the problem. Settle on the appropriate methodology (on-platform user survey combined with a large scale hold-out)

 - Articulate business value of the proposed research to cross-functional partners.

 - Design survey items. Build script for cognitive testing. Recruit third-party to perform cognitive testing. Ensure the survey instrument is easy to understand and the ux of the survey is good.

 - Design sampling strategy and implement sample. Settled on a stratified sampling strategy in order to ensure sufficient sample size for users targeted users.

 - Use simulation to complete power calcultaions

 - Complete internal approvals and compliance

 - Design and create survey instrument using internal tools

 - Implement survey sample using internal tools 

 - Clean, manage, analyze data. Use observables traits of all individuals in sample to adjust for non-response bias (iterative proportional weighting using the survey package in R). 

 - Design hold-out to test for the impact of platform experience on user sentiment and behavior 

 - Communicate key results in a way that made it clear - this is is a problem and we should do something about it (clean this up)

 - Prepare presentations for XFN and leadership. Make the case for (a) continuing investment in UX measurement, and (b) building a new product experience that 

# Impact: 
 - Support for UX measurement. Survey adopted as an ongoing source of truth about platform health

 - Up-level the UX org through code-sharing, mentorship, systematizing best practices
 
 - Successfully advocate for a new product experience that expanded user voice (what else?)
