# Project: Measure user experience to facilitate growth of a massive private messaging network

## Role: Staff Quantitative User Researcher

## Brief: Create a new source of information about users' experience of business messages. Ensure user experience remains positive as platform grows.

## Approach: 
 - **Leverage relationships** and **collaborate** with product and engineering to understand business needs and constraints
 - **Identify the contribution** of research to the problem and determine the appropriate methodology. **Articulate business value** of the proposed research to cross-functional partners.
 - **Design survey items**. Perform cognitive testing to ensure survey instrument is easy to understand and the ux of the survey is good.
 - **Design sampling strategy** and implement sample. Selected a stratified sampling strategy to ensure sufficient sample size for users targeted users. Use simulation to complete **power calcultaions**.
 - **Design hold-out** to test for the impact of platform experience on user sentiment and behavior.
 - Complete internal approvals and compliance to ensure **protection of research subjetcs**
 - Design and create survey instrument. **Implement** survey sample.
 - Clean, manage, and **analyze data**. Use observable traits of all individuals in sample to adjust for non-response bias (used iterative proportional weighting using the survey package in R).
 - **Communicate key results** in a way that made the problem, and the possible solutions, clear. Present strategically to XFN and leadership.

## Impact: 
 - **Gained leadership support** for UX measurement. Survey adopted as an ongoing source of truth about platform health.

 - **Up-leveled** the UX org through code-sharing, mentorship, systematizing best practices.
 
 - **Successfully advocated for a new product experience** that expanded user voice
